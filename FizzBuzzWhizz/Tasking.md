# TDD
TDD Circle
- Test Fails
  - You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
- Test Passes
  - You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.
  - You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
- Refactor
  - see the tests still passing
